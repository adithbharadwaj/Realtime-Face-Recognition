# Realtime-Face-Recognition

Realtime Face recognition in Python using OpenCV and Deep Learning. Detect a person in realtime 
using a webcam.

# Dependencies:

    1. Tensorflow
    
    2. Keras
    
    3. Numpy and Scipy
    
    4. Pandas
    
    5. Matplotlib
    
    6. OpenCV
    
# Utilities:

    1. Inception_blocks_v2.py: the inception model. The python implementation of 
       the inception model in Kerass.

    2. fr_utils.py: utility functions for processing the images.

    3. Pretrained Weights: We require the Pre-trained weights (Weights folder)
    
    
# Steps:

    1. to detect your face, Capture an image of your face using a webcam or any
       other device and save this image in the images folder.
       
    2. Run : python3 face_recog.py in your terminal
    
    3. Wait for some time. The webcam will start running and it will detect your face.
